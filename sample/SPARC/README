Background U & T -- SPARC climatology for July (80S-80N)

initial waves :
- every 5 deg from 40S to 75S
- launching height = 10km
- zonal wavelength = 314km
- relative freq. is zero = orographic waves assumed
 ( m is diagnosed at the source level )


Check meridional refraction and its dependency on wavenumber and frequency
