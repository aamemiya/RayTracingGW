Test -- Constant stability (N=0.018) and background wind (zero)

initial waves :
- every 5 deg from 65S to 75S
- launching height = 0km
- zonal wavelength = 314km
- relative freq. is 8.0e-4 
 ( m is diagnosed at the source level )
 ==> cgx is large positive value

Test for icur=1 and 0, and see how curvature terms work !!
