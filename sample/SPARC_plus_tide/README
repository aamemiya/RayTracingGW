Background U & T -- SPARC climatology for July (80S-80N)

Steady U(y,z) + Time dependent u'(x,z,t)

u' = A(z) * sin(2*pi*(kx+wt)) is loaded from SPARC/plus_tide/wind_tide.ascii

diurnal migrating tide (WN 1 and 1 cycle/day) with maximum u'=20m/s is prescribed in the default data.

initial waves :
- every 5 deg from 40S to 75S
- launching height = 10km
- zonal wavelength = 314km
- relative freq. is zero = orographic waves assumed
 ( m is diagnosed at the source level )


Check how relative frequency changes during propagation.
