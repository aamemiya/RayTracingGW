Background U & T -- SPARC climatology for July (80S-80N)

initial waves :
- every 5 deg from 40S to 75S
- ***** launching height = 40km *****
- zonal wavelength = 314km
- relative freq. is zero = orographic waves assumed
 ( m is diagnosed at the source level )

dt=-200  -- backward integration
iupwd=1 means Cpz > 0 -- backward (downward) tracing is performed
